## 🧠 Project Overview

Credit ratings influence billions in capital flows — but do raters behave differently in times of crisis?  
This project investigates whether human credit rating agencies add value or diverge from machine learning-based predictions during periods of financial instability. Using XGBoost and real-world corporate ratings data, we explore:

- 📉 **Prediction accuracy** during crisis vs. normal periods  
- 🤖 **Model-human disagreements** and their underlying drivers  
- 📊 **Feature analysis** of override patterns  
- 🔍 **Behavioral insights** into rating decisions across time

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `ML Final Project.ipynb` – the full analysis notebook  
- `corporate_ratings.csv` – cleaned dataset used in modeling

## 🧪 Methods Used

- XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning  
- Cross-validation with custom metrics  
- Confusion matrix + risk-adjusted scoring  
- Precision-Recall and ROC analysis  
- Time series resampling and crisis segmentation  
- Visualization with matplotlib & seaborn
