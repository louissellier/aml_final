## 🧠 Project Overview

Credit ratings influence billions in capital flows — but do raters behave differently in times of crisis?  
This project investigates whether human credit rating agencies add value or diverge from machine learning-based predictions during periods of financial instability. Using XGBoost and real-world corporate ratings data, we explore:

- 📉 **Prediction accuracy** during crisis vs. normal periods  
- 🤖 **Model-human disagreements** and their underlying drivers  
- 📊 **Feature analysis** of override patterns  
- 🔍 **Behavioral insights** into rating decisions across time

- `corporate_ratings.csv` – cleaned dataset used in modeling
